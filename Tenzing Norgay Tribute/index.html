          <h2>Tenzing Norgay's life:</h2>
          <p>Tenzing Norgay, or Sherpa Tenzing was born in Tengboche, a village in the Khumbu region of Northeastern Nepal. Tenzing ran away from home to Darjeeling, India, which was the starting point for expeditions into the Himalayas during that time. A year later, he had the opportunity to join an expedition to Mount Everest with Eric Shipton as a high altitude porter. He participated in four more unsuccessful summit attempts of Mount Everest between 1935 and 1953, working his way up from porter to full expedition member. In 1953, Tenzing joined John Hunt's expedition as a Edmund Hillary's climbing partner. The pair summitted Mount Everest for the first time on May 29, 1953.</p>
